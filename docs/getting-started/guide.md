# Yesselman Lab Guide

Welcome to the Yesselman Lab! This guide is here to help both new and current members thrive and integrate smoothly into the lab environment. Please make sure to read the sections that apply to your position (for instance, graduate students should refer to the graduate student expectations). You can use the table of contents on the left to quickly find the information you need.

!!! warning "Important"
    Mistakes happen, and making one occasionally is part of the learning process, don't worry! However, repeatedly breaking lab rules or disregarding expectations will lead to progressively more serious consequences, up to and including removal from the lab.

## Required Onboarding Steps

These are things that **all new members must do**:

### 1. Join Slack

All members should be on Slack, which is the messaging service we are using instead of email. I do not like email, thus all communications should be done through Slack, unless this relates to something in an email.

### 2. Get Access to Google Drive Lab Account

Make sure you can access the `yesselmanlab@gmail.com` Google Drive. All lab documents should be stored here.

## General Rules (Applies to Everyone)

### Communication

Open and reliable communication is essential for the success of our lab. I can't keep track of every detail each member is working on, so when we agree on a deadline or a follow-up, it's important that you follow through. If you realize you won't be able to meet a deadline or complete a task, let me know as soon as possible. It's absolutely okay to need more time or to encounter obstacles—what's not okay is failing to communicate.

### Slack Communication

We use Slack as our primary tool for day-to-day communication. Please make sure to have the app installed on both your computer and phone, not just the web app. Please make sure you have notifications turned on so you don't miss important updates. 

**During workdays, I expect responses within 24 hours at the latest** (this does not apply on weekends, holidays, or during vacations). You can expect the same responsiveness from me; I will do my best to reply promptly.

### Attendance and Scheduling

Each lab member will have a schedule agreed upon at the start. Please adhere to your schedule and do not miss work without notice. If you anticipate being late, absent, or need to adjust your hours, always send me a message on Slack in advance.

### Group Meeting

!!! warning "Important: Group Meeting Expectations"
    **Attendance at group meetings is required for all lab members.** Be present, be prepared, and participate actively—these meetings are essential for sharing progress, getting feedback, and building lab community. Let me know early if you have an unavoidable conflict. Repeated unexcused absences or disengagement may affect your standing in the lab.

Group meetings are a key part of our lab’s culture—they provide an opportunity to share research progress, brainstorm ideas, get feedback, and stay connected with what everyone is working on. Regular attendance ensures that everyone benefits from updates, discussion, support, and training.

I will do my best to schedule group meetings at times that accommodate everyone's schedules. If you have an unavoidable scheduling conflict, you must inform me **as early as possible** so we can try to find a workable alternative or discuss your absence in advance. Repeated, unexcused absences will be considered a serious matter and may reflect in your standing in the lab.

**Active participation** is expected from all attendees. Group meetings are meant to be collaborative—not a passive event or a punishment. Pay attention to whoever is speaking and ask questions if you are confused. Offer comments or advice when appropriate, and engage respectfully. Contributing actively helps the presenter and strengthens the group as a whole. 

**Electronic devices** (phones, laptops, tablets) should be used only for taking relevant notes or accessing material directly related to the meeting. Browsing unrelated websites, checking email, or doing other work is disrespectful and is not permitted during meetings. Please minimize distractions and give your full attention to the group. **Ideally, avoid using electronic devices unless necessary.**

If it’s your turn to present at group meeting **(Applies to Everyone)**:

- **Practice your presentation beforehand** to stay within the allotted time and reduce nervousness.
- **Check your slides** for typos, errors, and make sure figures and data are accurate and clear.
- Make your talk accessible to all lab members, including those from different backgrounds.
- Be ready to answer questions and encourage discussion—it’s okay not to know every answer!

Group meetings are for your benefit as much as anyone else's—use them as a time to learn, support each other, and strengthen the lab community.

### Lab Notebooks

Maintaining detailed, accurate, and up-to-date lab records is essential for both scientific rigor and day-to-day lab function. Every member of the lab—regardless of project or experience level—is responsible for ensuring their recordkeeping meets the highest standards. This means:

- **Experiments must be thoroughly documented:** Always use the lab notebook platform to record your work. Enter all procedures, solutions, samples, results, and any relevant metadata in real time or as soon as possible—do not rely on memory to fill in details later.
- **Protocol updates:** If an experimental protocol is updated or revised, promptly document the change in the digital protocol database and inform others who may be affected. The current version should always be accessible and clearly dated.
- **Deviations and troubleshooting:** If you modify a protocol or encounter unexpected problems, note exactly what was done differently and why, as well as any troubleshooting steps. Transparent records of deviations are crucial for troubleshooting and for others who may repeat your experiment.
- **Data storage:** All gel images, raw data files (e.g., instrument outputs), processed results, and experimental notes must be uploaded to protocol sheet. 
- **Naming and organization:** Use consistent and descriptive naming conventions for files and entries (see the section below on document naming) to aid both yourself and collaborators in future data retrieval.
- **Review:** Make it a habit to regularly review your records to ensure completeness and identify missing information early.

Good recordkeeping protects your work, supports discovery, and makes future analyses, publications, and collaborations possible. If you are ever unsure how to document something, ask a labmate or Joe for guidance—clear documentation is a key part of your responsibility as a researcher.

### How to Name / Send Documents

**How to Name and Organize Documents and Files**

To ensure clarity and consistency, follow these guidelines for naming all documents, files, and folders shared with me or posted in lab records:

#### 1. Standard File Name Structure

Name every document or file you send using this format:  
**`YYYY_MM_DD_INITIALS_DESCRIPTION[_VERSION][_TYPE]`**

- `YYYY_MM_DD` = The date you are sending or creating the file (4-digit year, 2-digit month, 2-digit day)
- `INITIALS` = Your initials (e.g., Jane D. Yesselman = JDY)
- `DESCRIPTION` = A very brief, descriptive phrase about the file’s content (e.g., "lab_guide" or "exp1_raw_data")
- `VERSION` (optional) = For drafts or updated versions: use `draft2`, `v3`, `revised`, etc.
- `TYPE` (optional) = Use meaningful file-types or experiment descriptors if helpful (e.g., "slides", "report", "data", "notes")

**Example 1**:  
`2025_09_19_JDY_yesselman_lab_guide.docx`  
**Example 2**:  
`2024_05_01_ABC_RNA_mapping_exp1_draft2.pdf`  
**Example 3** (raw data file):  
`2024_08_16_XYZ_RT_qpcr_plate1_v1.csv`

#### 2. Additional Naming Conventions

- **Avoid spaces and special characters:** Use underscores `_` to separate words. Do not use spaces, slashes, or other punctuation.
- **Be specific:** Name the file so someone outside your project could guess what it contains.
- **Always update the date** if you make a new version (especially for a new experiment or report).
- **Indicate versions clearly:** When revising a document, add `draft2`, `final`, or increment version numbers as necessary.
- **For related folders:** Use similar conventions. For example, `2024_05_10_JDY_RNAseq_analysis/`
- If you send multiple data files for the same date/experiment, add a suffix or sample/plate identifier (e.g., `exp2_sampleA`).

#### 3. File Type Examples

- Word/Google Doc: `2023_12_06_JDY_exp3_progress_report.docx`
- Raw data: `2023_12_06_JDY_exp3_FLR_raw.csv`
- Processed data: `2023_12_06_JDY_exp3_FLR_proc.csv`
- Slides: `2023_12_06_JDY_group_meeting_slides_v2.pptx`

**If you have already sent a document and you are sending a revision, always increment the version suffix or add `draft2`, `final`, etc., so that each file is clearly distinguishable.**

**If you are unsure how to name something, ask!** Consistent naming makes it much easier for everyone in the lab to locate, track, and understand important files.


### How to Read Scientific Papers

!!! warning "Important"
    Reading a scientific paper is not like reading a novel; it requires multiple read-throughs and to dive into all details of the methods. If you did not read and understand the methods of the paper, you likely are not really understanding the paper. This is one of the most important skills you will need as a scientist. 
    
Here are the recommended steps

For a detailed guide on reading scientific papers, see our [How to Read a Paper guide](how-to-read-a-paper.md).

This guide provides practical, step-by-step instructions for efficiently understanding and analyzing academic papers.

## Guidelines for Graduate Students

### Expectations for Coming into the Lab

Unless we have specifically agreed upon a different arrangement, **graduate students are expected to physically come into the lab every weekday (Monday through Friday), and remain for at least 8 hours each day**. In general, you should plan to arrive no later than 10 am, as regular morning attendance helps maintain consistency and enables collaboration with others in the lab.

While I cannot require you to work beyond 40 hours per week according to university and labor guidelines, it is important to recognize that success in graduate school often correlates with the time and effort you invest. From my experience, those who thrive and progress quickly in their projects tend to engage with their work well beyond the minimum required hours—both in and out of the lab—as science rarely fits neatly into a standard work schedule.

As your mentor, I am committed to modeling this ethic: I am present in the lab all 7 days a week and, even if you see me leave early on occasion, I usually continue working at home into the evening. However, I want to emphasize that taking breaks and maintaining your wellbeing are crucial for long-term success; you should communicate with me if you need adjustments to your schedule for personal reasons, health, or major commitments.

### Critical Thinking Is Essential

Getting a PhD means you will be a critical thinker. You will be expected to think critically about the data you are collecting, the experiments you are performing, and the results you are obtaining. You will be expected to think critically about the papers you are reading, and the ideas you are developing. You will be expected to think critically about the experiments you are performing, and the results you are obtaining. You will be expected to think critically about the papers you are reading, and the ideas you are developing.

### Following Instructions

I highly value independent thinking, creativity, and initiative—exploring your own ideas and trying new approaches is a vital part of your development as a scientist. However, it is also essential that when I assign a task or request that something be done, I expect you to carry it out in a timely and conscientious manner. Open communication is very important: if you have reservations, concerns, or disagree with an instruction I have given, please let me know as soon as possible so we can discuss it together. Our conversation may lead to a change of plans, a clearer understanding, or a compromise. Regardless of the outcome of that discussion, once we have agreed on a course of action, it is your responsibility to follow through and complete the task as discussed. This ensures smooth progress for both your project and the lab as a whole.

### One-on-One Meetings

All graduate students should be having **1:1 meetings with me every week**. These should be short meetings where you summarize what you have done and we discuss what to do next. **You are responsible for getting those set up with me.** Please have data ready—don't just describe it for me.

### Group Meeting

All graduate students will present at group meeting. Please make sure your talks have adequate background to explain your research. **You are expected to have new results to share each group meeting.** Although it is totally okay to include previous results to help motivate your current work.

### Reading Papers

All graduate students should be reading papers often. Generally, graduate students who succeed read **1-2 papers a week, every week**.

### Conference Presentations

I expect all graduate students to **present at least one conference a year**. This is important as it practices your ability to communicate research to other people. Please discuss with me what conferences would work or find ones that may be interesting.

## Undergraduate Student Rules

### Coming into Work

Please post your schedule in the **`#student-schedules`** channel on Slack. You are expected to stick with the schedule unless you tell me in advance.
