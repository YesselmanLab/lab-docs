# Yesselman Lab Guide / FAQ

This guide is designed to help new and current members succeed in the lab. All new members should read the sections relevant to their role (for example, graduate students should review the section on graduate student expectations). A table of contents is provided on the left side to help you quickly navigate to any section you need.

!!! warning "Important"
    Mistakes happen, and making one occasionally is part of the learning process, don't worry! However, repeatedly breaking lab rules or disregarding expectations will lead to progressively more serious consequences, up to and including removal from the lab.

## Required Onboarding Steps

These are things that **all new members must do**:

### 1. Join Slack

All members should be on Slack, which is the messaging service we are using instead of email. I despise email, thus all communications should be done through Slack, unless this relates to something in an email.

### 2. Get Access to Google Drive Lab Account

Make sure you can access the `yesselmanlab@gmail.com` Google Drive. All lab documents should be stored here.

## General Rules (Applies to Everyone)

### Communication

Open and reliable communication is essential for the success of our lab. I can't keep track of every detail each member is working on, so when we agree on a deadline or a follow-up, it's important that you follow through. If you realize you won't be able to meet a deadline or complete a task, let me know as soon as possible. It's absolutely okay to need more time or to encounter obstacles—what's not okay is failing to communicate.

### Slack Communication

We use Slack as our primary tool for day-to-day communication. Please make sure to have the app installed on both your computer and phone, not just the web app. Please make sure you have notifications turned on so you don't miss important updates. 

**During workdays, I expect responses within 24 hours at the latest** (this does not apply on weekends, holidays, or during vacations). You can expect the same responsiveness from me; I will do my best to reply promptly.

### Attendance and Scheduling

Each lab member will have a schedule agreed upon at the start. Please adhere to your schedule and do not miss work without notice. If you anticipate being late, absent, or need to adjust your hours, always send me a message on Slack in advance.

### Group Meeting

Attendance at group meetings is **required for all lab members**. I will make every effort to schedule meetings at a time that works for everyone. If the proposed time is a conflict for you, let me know right away so we can discuss alternatives. 

Group meetings are not a punishment and should be an active participation event for everyone. I expect people to be paying attention to the speaker and actively asking questions. You should not be browsing on your phone or computer—that is rude.

### Lab Notebooks

Accurate and up-to-date recordkeeping is a requirement for everyone in the lab. If you are performing experiments, please use the designated digital protocols. When a protocol changes, make sure the update is entered. If you deviate from a protocol, note the change clearly in your records. All gel images and experimental results should be uploaded to the digital sheets promptly.

### How to Send Documents

All documents sent to me should be in the format: **`DATE_YOUR_INITIALS_TITLE`**

**Example**: `2025_09_19_JDY_yesselman_lab_guide.docx`

If you have sent me the document already, please add `draft_2` or something so I can tell them apart.

### How to Read Scientific Papers

Reading a scientific paper is not like reading a novel; it requires multiple read-throughs and to dive into all details of the methods. If you did not read and understand the methods of the paper, you likely are not really understanding the paper. Here are the recommended steps:

1. **First read through the paper once** to just get a sense for what the paper is about

2. **Understand each method being used in the experiment.** Read the methods first to see if you can understand from that.

3. **If the method is unfamiliar to you**, get more information about it—see if ChatGPT knows, etc.

4. **Make sure you know exactly what data they are getting from the experiment** and separate that from the authors' interpretation of the data. For example, for chemical mapping: Chemical mapping modifies an RNA and we have ways of reading out where those modifications occur. It does not give us the structure—that is an interpretation of the data.

### How to Give Group Meeting (Applies to Everyone)

#### What is the Purpose of Group Meeting?

The purpose of group meeting is to give students practice presenting their research and receiving feedback.

## Graduate Student Rules

### Coming into Work

Unless we have discussed something else, **graduate students are expected to come into work every weekday and stay at least 8 hours**. Also, I expect people to come in at least by 10 am. 

I cannot ask people to work more than 40 hours a week, but from my past experience, most graduate students who succeed work much more than this. I myself work every day, and while you may see me leave early sometimes, I continue to work at home often until 10 pm.

### Following Instructions

While I absolutely encourage going out and trying your own ideas, if I ask you to do something, I expect you will do it. If you disagree with what I asked of you, please of course voice your disagreement. That may change my mind or not, but whatever we decide, you must follow through.

### One-on-One Meetings

All graduate students should be having **1:1 meetings with me every week**. These should be short meetings where you summarize what you have done and we discuss what to do next. **You are responsible for getting those set up with me.** Please have data ready—don't just describe it for me.

### Group Meeting

All graduate students will present at group meeting. Please make sure your talks have adequate background to explain your research. **You are expected to have new results to share each group meeting.** Although it is totally okay to include previous results to help motivate your current work.

### Reading Papers

All graduate students should be reading papers often. Generally, graduate students who succeed read **1-2 papers a week, every week**.

### Conference Presentations

I expect all graduate students to **present at least one conference a year**. This is important as it practices your ability to communicate research to other people. Please discuss with me what conferences would work or find ones that may be interesting.

## Undergraduate Student Rules

### Coming into Work

Please post your schedule in the **`#student-schedules`** channel on Slack. You are expected to stick with the schedule unless you tell me in advance.

## FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions

### I am sick. Should I go home?

**Yes!** Make sure to tell me that you are going home. You do not need to ask permission unless we are scheduled to do something like a meeting.

### Can I work from home?

**Yes**, if your work can be done from home and you let me know and you have no other commitments.

### Can I take a vacation?

**Yes**, if you let me know very much in advance (like weeks in advance). Everyone needs a break at some point. **All students get 2 weeks of vacation per year excluding federal holidays.**
