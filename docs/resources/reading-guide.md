## How to Use This Guide

### For Complete Beginners

1. **Start with Module 0** - Don't skip this! It provides essential context.
2. **Read sequentially** - Each module builds on previous knowledge.
3. **Take notes** - Write down key concepts and questions.
4. **Don't rush** - Understanding is more important than speed.

### For Students with Some Background

1. **Assess your knowledge** - Review Module 0 and 1 to identify gaps.
2. **Focus on weak areas** - Spend more time on modules covering unfamiliar topics.
3. **Skip ahead carefully** - Only skip modules if you're confident in the material.

### Reading Tips

- **Read abstracts first** - Get a sense of the paper before diving in.
- **Focus on figures** - They often convey key concepts more clearly than text.
- **Read methods** - Understanding how experiments work is crucial (see [Lab Guide FAQ](../getting-started/faq.md#how-to-read-scientific-papers)).
- **Discuss with others** - Lab meetings and study groups help understanding.
