# Protocols

This section contains detailed protocols for experimental and computational work in the lab.

## Experimental Protocols

- **[PCR](pcr.md)** - Polymerase Chain Reaction for DNA amplification
- **[Primer Assembly](primer-assembly.md)** - Constructing DNA/RNA sequences from oligonucleotides
- **[Sample Preparation](sample-preparation.md)** - Standard sample preparation procedures
- **[Data Collection](data-collection.md)** - Data collection and recording procedures

## Computational Protocols

- **[Data Preprocessing](data-preprocessing.md)** - Standard data preprocessing pipeline
- **[Analysis Pipeline](analysis-pipeline.md)** - Standard analysis workflow

## Protocol Standards

All protocols in this lab follow these standards:

1. **Documentation**: All steps must be clearly documented
2. **Reproducibility**: Protocols should be reproducible by others
3. **Version Control**: Protocols are version-controlled and dated
4. **Safety**: Safety considerations are always included

## Contributing Protocols

To add or update a protocol:

1. Create or edit the appropriate markdown file
2. Follow the existing format
3. Include all necessary details for reproducibility
4. Submit for review

## Questions?

If you have questions about any protocol, contact the protocol author or your lab mentor.
